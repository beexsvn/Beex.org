<h3>About Us</h3>

<p>BEEx.org is a community fundraising platform that enables individuals and groups to leverage their social networks to raise money for their favorite nonprofits by performing 'challenges.' Challenges come in all shapes and sizes, from individual pledges to lose a few pounds to thousand person pledges to dance for 36 hours. BEEx's proprietary challenge process is designed with three principles in mind: (1) narratives raise money, (2) networks transmit narratives, (3) sponsors value networks. BEEx is free to use and we take no transaction fees.</p>

<p>The company was founded at Northwestern University in 2007 by a group of friends who thought they could help their favorite nonprofit organizations by creating a tool that enabled passionate individuals to raise money through their social networks by performing actions.</p>

<p>We are driven by a profound faith in the creative process and it's ability to manifest innovative solutions to every seemingly complex problem. As long as the mission is true, nothing is impossible.</p>
