<p><strong>What is BEEx?</strong></p>
<p>BEEx.org is a community fundraising service that helps people mobilize their networks to raise money for their favorite nonprofits. Our first service is designed for people performing personal challenges to raise money for a cause.</p>
<p><strong>What is a challenge?</strong></p>
<p>A challenge is an action oriented fundraising initiative.  To perform a challenge, an individual pledges to perform an action if a certain amount of money is raised for the nonprofit of his/her choice.  Charity walks are the most common type of challenge.</p>
<p>All challenges on BEEx conform to the following formula:  I/we will x if y is raised for z nonprofit.</p>
<p>There are generally four broad categories of challenge:<br/>
1) The Self-Improvement Challenge where you do something your friends and family want you to do.<br/>
Ex. Quit smoking to raise money for a lung cancer nonprofit.<br/>
2) The Multiplier where you get people to give to charity in support of your 'goodness.'<br/>
Ex. Volunteering if people raise money for the nonprofit you're helping out.<br/>
3) The Self-Deprecating Challenge where you do something embarrassing or unexpected to show people you don't take yourself too seriously.<br/>
Ex. Wearing a chicken suit to work everyday for a week to raise money for an organic farming collective.<br/>
4) The Stunt is an action that is simply  outrageous.  Make sure it's not illegal, physically dangerous or pornographic because then we'll have to take it down and we will not refund the money people donated.  Sorry, we've got to be strict about this.</p>
<p><strong>Will people really care about my challenge?</strong></p>
<p>On the list of things people care about, you probably fit in somewhere between American Idol and Fantasy Football, which makes you relevant.  Whether or not your challenge enhances how much people care about you or diminishes it is up to you.  A The thing is, people care about you, they care about what you're doing, they care about what you're into, and they care about how you're feeling. The causes that you care about are really an extension of who you are as is what you're willing to do for them. So we think challenges create extra incentives for people to donate. It's no longer just the cause they're supporting, through challenges they are supporting the cause AND you.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any ideas for challenges?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, check out our wiki.</p>
<p><strong>What if I want to do something with my friends?</strong></p>
<p>There are two options: create a 'team' or a 'cluster.'</p>
<p><strong>What is a team?</strong></p>
<p>A team is a group participating in the same challenge.<br/>
Ex. Two people dancing together in a dance marathon.</p>
<p><strong>What is a cluster?</strong></p>
<p>A cluster is a collection of multiple challenges involved in a single activity. While each challenge within a cluster operates independently, they all share certain conditions controlled by the cluster creator (administrator). These conditions are often but not limited to items like date, time, benefiting nonprofit, fundraising goal, etc.<br/>
Ex. An individual running in a marathon.</p>
<p>When you invite people to join a cluster you've created, you're participating in community organizing. For some tips, check out our blog.</p>
<p><strong>Are My Donations Tax Deductible?</strong></p>
<p>The legal answer: consult a tax expert to be absolutely sure.  The common sense answer is this: only nonprofits with 501.c.3 status (tax deductible status) can register for BEEx and the money goes directly to those nonprofits without passing through any middlemen's hands so donating to a nonprofit through BEEx is just like donating to one through their website. Their website will most likely say to consult a tax professional so&hellip; you get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>What if I donate to a challenge but the challenger doesn't do what they promised to?</strong></p>
<p>We ask that every challenger post some sort of proof that they did what they promised to do. This usually comes in the form photos, videos, a scanned document, etc. The challenger is responsible for following through on their challenge. We don't have a police force (yet) so right now there's nothing we can do if people flake out&hellip; Easy solution: only donate to a challenge if you know the person who started it and think they're serious.  The other option is to be happy you were inspired to give, no matter the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>What are your transaction costs?</strong></p>
<p>We don't take a transaction fee. The only fees are those levied by the credit card processors. Right now our site accepts two processors, Paypal and Authorize.net. We encourage nonprofits to use Authorize.net because their fees are the lowest (2.2%-2.9%). Paypal's fees vary so you need to ask them about their fees.</p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, we have an affiliate relationship with Authorize.net which allows us to offer such a low transaction fee. If you know a lower fee processor, let us know and we'll start using them. We take pride in the fact that we offer the lowest transactions fees possible.</p>
<p><strong>Can I receive a refund? </strong></p>
<p>All donations are final on BEEx.org. The only circumstance we'd offer a refund is if we screw up something and you bring it to our attention. We'd like to have a more relaxed refund policy in the future but refunds are very expensive for us to process and make life very difficult for nonprofits and the IRS&hellip; and no one wants to make life difficult for the IRS.</p>
<p><strong>The nonprofit I'm looking for isn't in your database, what do I do? </strong></p>
<p>Email us (thefolks[at]beex.org] the nonprofit's name and we'll pitch them in the next day or two to sign up for BEEx. Our pitch is very convincing. We'll let you know when they register.</p>
<p><strong>Can challenges be canceled?</strong></p>
<p>A challenge can be cancelled/deleted/purged before it receives a donation. Once it receives a donation, it can't be cancelled. If something happens that makes the challenge impossible to continue and you want all donations from the challenge refunded, send us an email with your name, email, challenge title and reason for cancellation.  Most likely, we won't be able to refund the money and if you do this repeatedly we might  you off the site.  Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Is your site secure? </strong></p>
<p>Not right now but in a day or two we will be able to say this: BEEx.org is a secure site. We use SSL (https:// functionality) so all of your financial data is encrypted and safe.</p>
<p><strong>Wow, this all sounds awesome, who do I have to thank for this amazing service?</strong></p>
<p>Since we're all one, thank yourself.</p>
<p><strong>This site sucks, to whom do I complain? </strong></p>
<p>See above.</p>
