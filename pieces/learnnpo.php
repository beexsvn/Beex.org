<p><strong>What is BEEx?</strong></p>
<p>BEEx.org is a free community fundraising service that helps people mobilize their networks to raise money for their favorite nonprofits. Our first service is designed for people performing personal challenges to raise money for a cause.</p>
<p><strong>What is a challenge?</strong></p>
<p>To perform a challenge, an individual or group pledges to perform an action if a certain amount of money is raised for the nonprofit of his/her choice.  Charity walks are the most common type of challenge.</p>
<p>There are generally four broad categories of challenge:</p>
<p>1) The Self-Improvement Challenge where you do something your friends and family want you to do.<br/>
Ex. Quit smoking to raise money for a lung cancer nonprofit.<br/>
2) The Multiplier where you get people to give to charity in support of your 'goodness.'<br/>
Ex. Volunteering if people raise money for the nonprofit you're helping out.<br/>
3) The Self-Deprecating Challenge where you do something embarrassing or unexpected to show people you don't take yourself too seriously.<br/>
Ex. Wearing a chicken suit to work everyday for a week to raise money for an organic farming collective.<br/>
4) The Stunt is an action that is simply  outrageous.  Make sure it's not illegal, physically dangerous or pornographic because then we'll have to take it down and we will not refund the money people donated.  Sorry, we've got to be strict about this.</p>
<p><strong>What is a cluster?</strong></p>
<p>A cluster is a collection of multiple challenges involved in a single activity. While each challenge within a cluster operates independently, they all share certain conditions controlled by the cluster creator (administrator). These conditions are often but not limited to items like date, time, benefiting nonprofit, fundraising goal, etc.<br/>
Ex. An individual running in a marathon.</p>
<p>When you invite people to join a cluster you've created, you're participating in community organizing. For some tips, check out our <a href="http://blog.beex.org/?tag=tips" title="Tips">blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How can I use clusters to benefit my organization?</strong></p>
<p>As the leader of a nonprofit you've probably seen how important it is to have an online fundraising presence. Unfortunately for many organizations, the existing software is prohibitively expensive and complicated to use. We provide a free alternative that requires no training and no overhead expense. Our platform is also designed to meet the needs of the modern internet user. This means easy integration with things like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and E-Mail. We empower your supporters to leverage their own networks to support your mission. So whether it is an existing event like a marathon or you want to plan something new, using BEEx is an easy way to organize your supporters online and help them raise more money for you.</p>
<p><strong>If we want to do something new, does your organization help us think of great ideas?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we made this wiki that is full of ideas. We enjoy brainstorming challenge and cluster ideas. You can also find helpful <a href="http://blog.beex.org/?tag=tips">tips</a> on our blog</p>
<p><strong>How do we receive donations?</strong></p>
<p>We have two different methods for you to receive money on the site.</p>
<p>1. If you have a PayPal account we can connect it to our site and you can receive donations right through your PayPal. Normal PayPal costs apply which tend to be a bit higher than our system.</p>
<p>2. You can register an Authorize.net merchant account through us.  Authorize.net is one of the world's largest processors.   We've negotiated a special deal for merchant accounts.</p>
<p>Registration Fee: $100<br/>
Monthly Fee: $28.<br/>
Transaction Fee: 2.19%<br/>
Per Transaction Fee: 35&cent;</p>
<p>You can use this account for all your online transaction needs including your own website's shopping cart.  We recommend this option for any nonprofit that plans to raise more than $1000/month online.</p>
<p>Please contact us if you'd like to set up a merchant account.</p>
<p><strong>How do we sign up?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How can sponsors get involved?</strong></p>
<p>We've created a unique opportunity for your organization to package and sell a social media, cause branded sponsorship to a supporting corporation. You'll notice on the challenge and cluster pages there is a space you can purchase from us to promote your sponsors. We believe that little box is the evolution of online advertising. It will travel with your cluster anywhere on the internet, meaning it will show up in Facebook, emails, blogs, and anywhere else you use BEEx tools. That space costs $5 to activate on a cluster and $3 on each challenge. Depending on the size and scope of your initiative, that sponsorship can be worth thousands of dollars to potential corporate sponsors.</p>
