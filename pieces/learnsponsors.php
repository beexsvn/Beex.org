<p><strong>What is BEEx?</strong></p>
<p>BEEx.org is a community fundraising service that helps people mobilize their networks to raise money for their favorite nonprofits. Our first service is designed for people performing personal challenges to raise money for a cause.</p>
<p><strong>What is a challenge?</strong></p>
<p>A challenge is an action oriented fundraising initiative.  To perform a challenge, an individual pledges to perform an action if a certain amount of money is raised for the nonprofit of his/her choice.  Charity walks are the most common type of challenge.</p>
<p>All challenges on BEEx conform to the following formula:  I/we will x if y is raised for z nonprofit.</p>
<p>There are generally four broad categories of challenge:<br/>
1) The Self-Improvement Challenge where you do something your friends and family want you to do.<br/>
Ex. Quit smoking to raise money for a lung cancer nonprofit.<br/>
2) The Multiplier where you get people to give to charity in support of your 'goodness.'<br/>
Ex. Volunteering if people raise money for the nonprofit you're helping out.<br/>
3) The Self-Deprecating Challenge where you do something embarrassing or unexpected to show people you don't take yourself too seriously.<br/>
Ex. Wearing a chicken suit to work everyday for a week to raise money for an organic farming collective.<br/>
4) The Stunt is an action that is simply  outrageous.  Make sure it's not illegal, physically dangerous or pornographic because then we'll have to take it down and we will not refund the money people donated.  Sorry, we've got to be strict about this.</p>
<p><strong>What is a cluster?</strong></p>
<p>A cluster is a collection of multiple challenges involved in a single activity. While each challenge within a cluster operates independently, they all share certain conditions controlled by the cluster creator (administrator). These conditions are often but not limited to items like date, time, benefiting nonprofit, fundraising goal, etc.<br/>
Ex. An individual running in a marathon.</p>
<p>When you invite people to join a cluster you've created, you're participating in community organizing. For some tips, check out our blog.</p>
<p><strong>Can you help me produce a more successful challenge?</strong></p>
<p>We're creating a large knowledge resource around the topic of internet and social media fund raising.  Right now, this content lives in the <a href="../?cat=21">'Advice' section of the BEExBlog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is a sponsorship?</strong></p>
<p>A BEEx sponsorship is an opportunity for you to integrate your brand into a BEEx challenge.  By becoming a sponsor of a BEEx challenge, you can place an image of your choice (maybe your logo) right next to the donate button of a BEEx challenge and/or cluster.  Your logo will also appear in the automatically generated email alerts that are sent about challenge updates to BEEx challenges.</p>
<p><strong>How can I sponsor a challenge or cluster?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, the only way to sponsor a challenge or cluster is by contacting it's creator.  Creators purchase the ability to upload sponsors to their challenge or cluster from BEEx.  This is our how we earn money.</p>
<p><strong>How much does a sponsorship cost?</strong></p>
<p>Challengers and cluster creators pay us a small fee for the ability to upload their sponsors.  The arrangements made between creators and sponsors is of no concern to BEEx.</p>
<p><strong>Do sponsors pay the benefiting nonprofits?</strong></p>
<p>Sponsors arrange with the creator of the challenge or cluster to become the sponsor.  The arrangement may or may not include donating to the nonprofit.  BEEx is not involved with that relationship.</p>
<p><strong>How do I contact the creator of a challenge?</strong></p>
<p>We suggest posting on their blog or finding them via the social web.  We can also connect you for a small fee.  If you're interested, please email us at folks[at]beex.org with the subject line 'sponsorship'.</p>
