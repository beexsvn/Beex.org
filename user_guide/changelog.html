<h2>Version 1.7</h2>
<p>Release Date: October 23, 2008<br />
SVN Revision: 1541</p>

<ul>
	<li>Libraries
		<ul>
			<li>Added a new <a href="libraries/form_validation.html">Form Validation Class</a>.  It simplifies setting rules and field names, supports arrays as field names, allows groups of validation rules to be saved in a config file, and adds some helper functions for use in view files.  <strong>Please note that the old Validation class is now deprecated</strong>. We will leave it in the library folder for some time so that existing applications that use it will not break, but you are encouraged to migrate to the new version.</li>
			<li>Updated the <a href="libraries/sessions.html">Sessions class</a> so that any custom data being saved gets stored to a database rather than the session cookie (assuming you are using a database to store session data), permitting much more data to be saved.</li>
			<li>Added the ability to store libraries in subdirectories within either the main "libraries" or the local application "libraries" folder. Please see the <a href="libraries/loader.html">Loader class</a> for more info.</li>
			<li>Added the ability to assign library objects to your own variable names when you use <kbd>$this->load->library()</kbd>. Please see the <a href="libraries/loader.html">Loader class</a> for more info.</li>
			<li>Added controller class/method info to <a href="general/profiling.html">Profiler class</a> and support for multiple database connections.</li>
			<li>Improved the "auto typography" feature and moved it out of the helper into its own <a href="libraries/typography.html">Typography Class</a>.</li>
			<li>Improved performance and accuracy of <kbd>xss_clean()</kbd>, including reduction of false positives on image/file tests.</li>
			<li>Improved <a href="./libraries/parser.html">Parser class</a> to allow multiple calls to the parse() function.  The output of each is appended in the output.</li>
			<li>Added <dfn>max_filename</dfn> option to set a file name length limit in the  <a href="libraries/file_uploading.html">File Upload Class</a>.</li>
			<li>Added <dfn>set_status_header()</dfn> function to <a href="libraries/output.html">Output class</a>.</li>
			<li>Modified <a href="libraries/pagination.html">Pagination</a> class to only output the "First" link when the link for page one would not be shown.</li>
			<li>Added support for mb_strlen in the <a href="libraries/form_validation.html">Form Validation</a> class so that multi-byte languages will calculate string lengths properly.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Database
		<ul>
			<li>Improved Active Record class to allow full path column and table names:  hostname.database.table.column.  Also improved the alias handling.</li>			
			<li>Improved how table and column names are escaped and prefixed.  It now honors full path names when adding prefixes and escaping.</li>
			<li>Added Active Record caching feature to "update" and "delete" functions.</li>
			<li>Added removal of non-printing control characters in <kbd>escape_str()</kbd> of DB drivers that do not have native PHP escaping mechanisms (mssql, oci8, odbc), to avoid potential SQL errors, and possible sources of SQL injection.</li>
			<li>Added port support to MySQL, MySQLi, and MS SQL database drivers.</li>
			<li>Added driver name variable in each DB driver, based on bug report #4436.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Helpers
		<ul>
			<li>Added several new "setting" functions to the <a href="helpers/form_helper.html">Form helper</a> that allow POST data to be retrieved and set into forms.  These are intended to be used on their own, or with the new <a href="libraries/form_validation.html">Form Validation Class</a>.</li>
			<li>Added <kbd>current_url()</kbd> and uri_segments() to  <a href="helpers/url_helper.html">URL helper</a>.</li>
			<li>Altered <kbd>auto_link()</kbd> in the <a href="helpers/url_helper.html">URL helper</a> so that email addresses with "+" included will be linked.</li>
			<li>Added <kbd>meta()</kbd> function to  <a href="helpers/html_helper.html">HTML helper</a>.</li>
			<li>Improved accuracy of calculations in <a href="helpers/number_helper.html">Number helper</a>.</li>
			<li>Removed added newlines ("\n") from most form and html helper functions.</li>
			<li>Tightened up validation in the <a href="helpers/date_helper.html">Date helper</a> function <kbd>human_to_unix()</kbd>, and eliminated the POSIX regex.</li>
			<li>Updated <a href="helpers/date_helper.html">Date helper</a> to match the world's current time zones and offsets.</li>
			<li>Modified url_title() in the <a href="helpers/url_helper.html">URL helper</a> to remove characters and digits that are part of
				character entities, to allow dashes, underscores, and periods regardless of the $separator, and to allow uppercase characters.</li>
			<li>Added support for arbitrary attributes in anchor_popup() of the <a href="helpers/url_helper.html">URL helper</a>.</li>
		</ul>

			<li>Added a file lock check during caching, before trying to write to the file.</li>
			<li>Modified Cookie key cleaning to unset a few troublesome key names that can be present in certain environments, preventing CI from halting execution.</li>
			<li>Changed the output of the profiler to use style attribute rather than clear, and added the id "codeigniter_profiler" to the container div.</li>
